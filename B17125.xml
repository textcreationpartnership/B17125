            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE Answer of Wapping TO THE Reply of White-Chappel.</head>
            <p>THE <hi>Reply</hi> of <hi>White-Chappel</hi> would endeavour to confute our just Allegations, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Objects of so much pity both in our Church and Lay State, We hope this our most true and modest Answer will be accepted.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They assert that about</hi> 12 <hi>years ago</hi> Wapping <hi>had almost as many houses as</hi> White-Chappel <hi>and say its believed that now we are above a third part,</hi> &amp;c. 'Twas warily express'd <hi>Houses</hi> not <hi>Persons;</hi> knowing that most of our <hi>Houses</hi> are very small and inhabited by poor Seamen, &amp;c. therefore <hi>(tho many)</hi> have but few persons in them. But since that time, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Hundreds of new, large, and beautiful houses have been erected in the Upper Hamlet; many of which are of 30 or 40 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and contain great and rich Families: so that it's believed by many of their <hi>own Hamlet,</hi> that we are not a <hi>Fifth</hi> part.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>They say their accidental poor is much greater than formerly,</hi> &amp;c. All persons are sensible what a severe year this hath been to the poor, thro want of imployment and scarcity of food, no wonder therefore if <hi>this year</hi> they have found an increase. But <hi>Wapping</hi> which under 20 years ago paid no Overcess for accidental poor, hath for <hi>several</hi> years last past, been constrain'd to raise above 200 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> Overcess, so that by their way of Computation, if they are 8 times, we are 200 times poorer than formerly.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Repairs of the <hi>Church,</hi> we hope 'tis so unreasonable, that it needs no Answer.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the High-ways, we answer in general,</p>
            <p>That time out of mind we never paid but 6 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> towards the High-ways, which continued till about the year 1679, till which time we had Surveyors of our own, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by that time pav'd our own High-ways, which were formerly gravell'd (which in our own Hamlet, not in another Parish (as they falsly affirm) cost so much money) They took the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of breaking the Old Contract, and have since most grievously burthen'd us by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Expences</hi> and <hi>unjust Collections;</hi> having in one year collected in our Hamlet 17 <hi>l.</hi> more than they brought to Account.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Church-lane</hi> (which they insist on) is no High-way but only a Back-lane.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>White-Chappel</hi> hath great advantages in point of Trade, by the Road, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend is so very chargeable; having in particular a Hay Market in their Street thrice a Week, and from every Hay Cart they receive 2 <hi>d.</hi> for their Scavengers and 2 <hi>d.</hi> to each House be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore which they stand: But no benefit accrues to <hi>Wapping</hi> by the Road, they being above a Mile distant from it.</p>
            <p>* <hi>The Scavengers have formerly let their Profits for</hi> 25 l. per Annum <hi>to one</hi> Walker.</p>
            <p>Why the last years Charge was greater than formerly (abating their exorbitant Expences, will be set forth by our Witnesses, and likewise why we chose Collectors of our own; but it's very wonderful that the <hi>same Road</hi> which according to their Ratiocination) but 14 years ago, cost but 18 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> should now cost above 200 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to St. <hi>Anns</hi> and St. <hi>James,</hi> they had no High-ways of their own, or some other great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son continued their Contributions; on the other side <hi>Shadwell</hi> a neighbouring Parish, in the year 1670 was made distinct from <hi>Stepney,</hi> without being burthen'd with Contributions to the High-ways of <hi>Stepney.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Touching the <hi>Outlets</hi> of the Common Sewers, The sum of their Answer is, <hi>That we dwell in drained ground, which was formerly under water, which did then receive the water of the Ʋpland; therefore it ought to do so still without any consideration.</hi> We reply by asking them <hi>What help did the Ʋpland High ways receive from this ground when under water?</hi> Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute no more now, than the ground did before drained, and the dispute is ended: And we hope it will appear not very reasonable that the Upland should receive all the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but bear nothing of the Burthen of the lower ground: And when an industrious people have made <hi>dry land</hi> of a <hi>Marsh,</hi> and are at the yearly expence of vast Sums to keep up their Fences against the Water, and when notwithstanding all their care, they often su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stain great damages by the Water, they hope the <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of our <hi>Legislators</hi> will consider and commiserate their Condition.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As to the Charities, we deny their great untruth that we have more than they, or bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit from the River: And let them but produce the Donations, if we are excluded in any particular, we desire not a part; but those that are given to the Parish in generall, without my restriction, we must claim to; which have been demanded particularly by <hi>Philip D'As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signy</hi> late Chappel-warden, but shiftingly refused; and have been ever since wrongfully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd by the Upper Hamlet; <hi>Which will be more than an equivalent to their High-ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We therefore pray this <hi>Honourable House</hi> to weigh our Condition, and since we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this Extremity, that we must let our Chappel fall, and the Publick Offices of Religion perish, if we are continued in the same State we are. We therefore hope we shall find relief, in being made Parochial.</p>
